# BrowserifyCommonJS
This app uses JSHint and JSCS to lint JavaScript code, and Browserify to build your modules for the browser.

## To get this running
### Gulp tasks are all under the under Gulp folder, pay special attention to the Browserify task
1. Open cmd/shell prompt to app directory
2. Run command ```npm install``` (will install all modules in pacakge.json)
3. Run command ```gulp``` (will run the default task and all its dependencies)
4. Open index page in a browser
5. Use dev tools to see output to the console
